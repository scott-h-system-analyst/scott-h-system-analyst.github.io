        <h2 data-number="2.1" id="related-work-history"><span
        class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Related Work
        History</h2>
        <p>I started my IT career as a computer salesperson of personal
        computers: IBM PCs/Compatibles, CP/M-80, and the odd <a
        href="http://www.thebattles.net/sage/">Sage with UCSD p-System
        OS</a>. Prior to PCs, information processing systems required
        many people to operate and maintain them, as well as reliance on
        large corporations that often owned the hardware, leasing the
        systems to users. With PCs, organizations could scale and
        operate with agency. A typical sale involved business and system
        analysis. A customer would have a problem they needed to solve,
        and the sale would revolve around that problem. I would often go
        onsite after the sale to help bring the system operational
        within their organization. I remember needing to use a hex
        editor on a WordStar word processing binary file to match
        superscript/subscript commands for a customer‚Äôs printer. I
        helped with a successful political campaign by selling a
        politician a PC and helping her load and configure her database
        for mailings. She won her state representative campaign, and
        later went on to become a member of the US House of
        Representatives. These experiences stayed with me, ingrained as
        both as an illustration of the benefit of information
        technology, but also let me see a time of revolution, when
        stakeholders had technological and operational agency. Apple
        Computer <a href="https://youtu.be/VtvjbmoDx-I">was also tuned
        in</a> to this revolution. Who would have imagined that we would
        eventually cede that agency to a handful of cloud corporations,
        after winning the revolution from corporate compute once? Even
        routine office applications, the staple applications of
        spreadsheets, databases, and word processing applications have
        moved to cloud. The handful of apex cloud companies require many
        other cloud companies to operate, and as stakeholders in
        organizations that desire information processing systems,
        connectivity is also required. I watched and participated in the
        entire transition, and understand the reasons; however, I have
        never lost the memory of that excitement and freedom.</p>
        <p>I spent a total of five years selling personal computers,
        obtained a degree in math. My career moved on to enterprise IT
        with the widespread adoption of networking in 1994. I got a job
        at an IT consulting firm as a technician and helpdesk for the
        main and satellite office. This single company morphed through
        an initial joining of four founding companies across six cities,
        into a nation-wide consulting company in 25 cities. I developed
        my own early form of DevOps to assist with this. I would ask
        managers at the acquired companies to fill out a spreadsheet of
        applications, users, shares, and permissions, and I would feed
        that into a Perl script that would configure NT servers (BDC and
        PDC) for each location.</p>
        <p>The complexity of the resulting system required automation
        and third party software to manage. I learned an early
        enterprise IT system management platform, Unicenter TNG, but
        added my own automation, as the GUI was cumbersome.</p>

        <p>As we acquired companies, IT operations and engineering was
        directed to push expenditures into the cost of acquisitions.
        Combined with ‚Äúgoodwill‚Äù, I saw how acquisitions could create a
        seemingly healthy company, yet there was no real operational
        agency or strategy that unified the acquired companies for
        healthy profit. I confronted our accountant about this in a
        diplomatic way, and she said, ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt supposed to know about
        that.‚Äù Upper management felt that they could gain control of the
        monolith they had built with enough business intelligence (BI),
        so they put in <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000816080519/http://www.cognos.com/about/">Cognos</a>.
        On their own, the leaders who had built the successful
        individual consulting companies understood how they ran, and
        what they were all doing together. The combined roll-up,
        particularly with the accounting strategy of acquisitions,
        caused a crippling cognitive dissonance for shared intention and
        overall health. This was my first glimpse of <a
        href="https://youtu.be/f9g4-5-GKBc">black box BI</a> used to
        mitigate lack of human cognition. Human cognition should come
        first. What are our strengths? What do we have to offer the
        world that is unique? How do we gauge success? Once these
        broader questions are answered, BI can be used to ensure the
        organization is tracking to intent. The roll-up failed, tried to
        re-invent itself, and sold for a decent sum. I was laid off, and
        was one of the last ones shutting down the datacenter.</p>
        <p>In 2001, I got a job working for a startup that provided
        inventory management and combined purchasing for health food
        stores. Most of the stores were connected with dial-up lines.
        With a crew of three, I deployed and managed 150 stores with
        POS/PC systems, centrally updated inventory databases, and
        updated frequently changing software at the stores, including
        Palm OS devices that handled the scanning. This, combined with
        the Unicenter TNG work I had done previously, gave me a decent
        insight into the coming DevOps perspective that infrastructure
        was code. Folks, this was nightly CI/CD to 150 stores over
        dial-up lines.</p>
        <figure>

        <p>Folks, this was nightly CI/CD to 150 stores over dial-up
        lines.</p>
        <p>When the company got tight on money, it used the float from
        the store purchases for operations. This has a similar kind of
        problem as rolling operational costs into acquisitions.
        Everything is great as long as you are expanding, but a lull can
        be devastating.</p>
        <p>I then got a job in 2003 for a medical ASP (ASP=Application
        Service Provider. It is what they called cloud before it became
        SaaS). In addition to building out and monitoring the front-end
        servers, I worked on their remit downloads, verification, and
        processing. While there, I created my first data flow,
        documenting my work. I used the same diagramming tools I used
        for my Z-80 homebrew schematic.</p>

        <p>Like the previous two jobs, this company failed as well;
        however, it failed because of technical reasons. There was a
        misconfigured cross-connect between switches that caused
        performance problems. I count this as one of my bigger failures
        in my career. While I was not part of the networking team (of
        two), the pool of servers I designed, built, and operated, ran
        across the multiple switches. Eventually I was able to figure
        out the problem after the main network engineer left; however,
        it took way too long, and we had lost most of our business by
        then. I should have been more active, earlier on, in
        troubleshooting a solution. My lack of engagement across silos
        was arguably the reason for the failure of the company. What is
        very interesting about this, is that all of the silo groups
        (networking, apps, compute, storage, database) had lots of
        real-time reporting of the systems. I had several myself. I even
        put in <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230218193443/https://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/demo.png">SmokePing</a>
        and created other network testing tools that measured TCP
        latency to my servers (vs.¬†just ICMP). None of our reporting got
        to the root problem. Not once did we all got together in a room
        and discuss all of the pieces together to try and brainstorm a
        solution. There were many conference calls, which impressed on
        me that in-person brainstorming is better. Instead of true
        collaboration, we just created lots and lots of reporting that
        tended to show why the problem wasn‚Äôt within our silo.</p>
        <p>In 2006 I got a job as a system architect at a global law
        firm. Within the first two weeks of my job at the firm, I jumped
        right in to a critical project. They were trying to solve the
        problem of running discovery apps over latent links. They also
        had a horrible network that aggravated this, but they weren‚Äôt
        aware of just how bad it was, and wanted to buy an app to solve
        a particular symptom. The CIO set up a meeting, and I met along
        with my assigned project manager to establish the timeline for
        rollout on my first week on the job. The CIO put me on the spot,
        and I figured no big deal, I would figure out how it worked,
        what people needed the first week, get the vendor
        recommendations, and put it in by week two. My project manager,
        who was previously a project manager that worked at NASA on the
        space shuttle, was not happy that I had answered in this way. I
        told her I would back it up, and responded with a two paragraph
        email that had bullet points for how I saw the project being
        implemented. She came back, waving the email at me, and said
        that what I gave her was entirely unacceptable. I was confused
        and thought she was abusing me (she wasn‚Äôt).</p>
        <p>I went to my boss, a wonderful boss that was generous and
        thought broadly. She gave me an example of what was needed. This
        is how I was introduced to the concept of a solution design
        document. It is a form of knowledge that describes where we are
        now and where we want to be in standard terms, so that everybody
        can agree. Not every aspect needed to be filled out. It varied
        by solution. In the years that followed, I realized that if the
        information applied to a system at all, at some point during the
        procurement, deployment, or operation of the system, the aspects
        would come up. From that time forward, I insisted on creating an
        appropriately scaled solution description for every medium+
        project I worked on. My work experience so far showed the value
        of this level of detail. My insistence on solution description
        documentation, though, was increasingly received poorly over
        time. It was perceived as a drag on ‚Äúagility‚Äù.</p>
        <p>I moved on to a point of sale system to cloud for a brick and
        mortar retailer, and moved on again to a pioneer of internet
        search that was re-inventing itself after losing the search wars
        to a current cloud giant. I was in charge of all monitoring.
        There was a brilliant person in charge of IT that had replaced
        the typical relational database reporting with decomposed data
        that was then fed into reporting and analysis engines, kind of
        like the modern Elastic. I realized that key-value pairs in
        event streams could be much more effectively analyzed than
        canned relational reports. This is the idea of Splunk and I
        evangelized Splunk. I also struggled with the simplest tasks of
        reporting on all monitors across thousands of servers. Nodes in
        a monitoring system do not fit well into a relational database.
        Most machines are different, even if they are the same model. I
        found that NoSQL approaches worked better for reporting on
        monitor classes.</p>
        <div class="boxup">
        <p>
        At this point, 2011, I have in my kit: streams via key-value
        pairs and analysis via Splunk, knowledge management, formal
        solution description/design documents, graphs for resilience
        (homebrew) and graphs for reporting (monitors)
        </div>
        <p>I was hot on the key-value pair stream analysis track. I
        moved on to another startup, where I could do anything I wanted
        in IT as long as it was fast enough and fit the requirements of
        the money that backed us (large banks). I struggled with my main
        developer to build out an analysis platform for an upcoming
        launch. I finally just did it all myself in two weeks using
        GNU/Linux, BASH, Perl to capture and normalize the data, and ran
        it all into Splunk as key-value pairs, happily proving my ideas
        from my previous job. I used my skills in system documentation
        to demonstrate to the banks our systems were secure and
        protected. This company also failed because of lack of
        funding.</p>
        <p>I moved on to another law firm, which had a similar cycle of
        projects that my solution design skills worked well for;
        however, there are some cracks starting to show. There was no
        longer an architecture team, and the meaning of engineering and
        design had degraded to quick vendor meetings and a few notes. I
        remember one design consideration that I focused on that was
        particularly difficult for people to grok. Backup retention was
        complicated at a law firm because of discovery. If email and
        deleted files were only retained for 30 days, then discovery was
        easier to comply with. The cognitive ability for somebody to
        include backup retention from a discovery perspective, backup
        retention from a critical files perspective, and off-site
        replication and storage, was stretched so far, that additional
        questions about backup retention of critical files were quickly
        brushed off as already dealt with. The scenario I was focused on
        was if data is corrupted or purposefully deleted and not
        discovered until after 30 days. Certainly there are important
        files at a law firm where this needed to be addressed, but the
        collapse of the architecture-&gt;engineering-&gt;operations
        roles was coming down on my head as I struggled. I met over ten
        times over the course of a year to get a proper backup retention
        policy in place. I finally got the operations team to put in a
        fix; however, they couldn‚Äôt figure out how to make it permanent
        for more than a year, and I had to set a yearly notice on my
        calendar to remind them to put in the the one-off interval
        backup. This also means that the only files in the entire global
        law firm, at that time, that were backed up outside of the 30
        day retention policy, were my files that I had specifically
        adjusted for. I had no indication that after all of this fight,
        that it had sunk in that we needed a broader policy to cover
        other files, and I had used up more than my allotted attention
        fighting for this one backup design requirement aspect. This
        experience inspired me to figure out how to break down
        requirements and design considerations in ways that stakeholders
        could understand. As an analyst, the problem is my problem, not
        the stakeholders‚Äô.</p>
        <p>In addition to the increasing cognitive challenges for
        operations folks trying to shepherd design considerations, the
        level of documentation, even in its simplest form, was too much
        for most people to understand. I think that the worst part was
        the long narrative form. Work and associated design knowledge
        was being broken down while I was building my analysis and
        collaboration skills up. More and more I would find that even
        engineering managers could only digest a couple sentences. There
        was a perception by management that long-form analysis documents
        were part of the old world. The new world was agile. When
        network, security, storage, and OS dependencies are stripped
        away, i.e.¬†all that remains are containers and cloud services,
        the scope gets narrow enough that the developers can just write
        the app, show it to users, and in a tightly coupled loop deliver
        and improve products without much engineering or architecture. I
        imagine that most who are in IT and are tracking my story here,
        would recognize that agile doesn‚Äôt necessarily have anything to
        do with design and architecture, but we are back to human
        cognition. The perceived freedom of agile is that there is
        constant progress, but in practice it comes from sacrificing
        system cognition by the humans participating in the agile
        workstreams. There are plenty of cattle. <a
        href="https://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/">Pets
        are too expensive</a>. Just rely on the cloud company to supply
        the feedlots and slaughterhouses.</p>
        <p>One project, though, changed my life again, just as
        significantly as the NASA project manager did at the previous
        law firm. I was put on a project to convert the public finance
        group from paper workflow to electronic.</p>
        <p>I needed something that captured the system in an abstract
        way that could be reviewed with the group. The default Visio
        model that looked best was Gane and Sarson. It had three
        symbols. It made more sense than UML. More importantly, it
        solved the biggest problem I had so far: an easy and
        understandable way to provide levels of different detail. Gane
        and Sarson is a data flow model (DFD). Information Technology,
        at root, deals with data flow. There are many other perspectives
        that formal enterprise architecture frameworks capture, but data
        flow is the lowest common denominator. I used it to analyze
        several systems since, at full detail, and it is quite flexible,
        particularly with some of the constraints and conventions I have
        added.</p>
        <p>In 2018 I moved on to a company that offered wellness
        programs and coaching to employers. We had an outsourced
        engineering and design team, located overseas, with product
        management handled locally. I was meant to bridge that gap. Much
        of the business workflow was spread through a cloud service that
        cost a lot of money, and there was a desire to untangle the
        systems from this service. The workflow was coded over time by
        many people, and it touched every aspect of their business. It
        was not documented. It was a perfect candidate for a DFD. I
        created a system-wide DFD. Upper management and stakeholders
        found the method helpful, but the problem was that it was
        difficult to match the velocity of the product and engineering
        teams. I did some research on how to increase velocity, found
        that triples could help, and pitched it to the company, but they
        said my ideas were too advanced for them, and in 2019 I was laid
        off. I have worked on the ideas on my own since then.</p>

        <p>I was young and foolish to not use jack stands; however, I

        slack, but my-o-my, seeing the car balanced on that bottle jack
        makes me shake my head and offer advice I likely wouldn‚Äôt have
        heeded anyway. My ‚Äútoolbox‚Äù was that big metal bowl in the
        foreground.</p>
        <p>The technical service manual I had for my 1963 Rambler
        American was incorrect. I created a correct diagram for intake
        and exhaust valves using Xfig, the same program I created my
        first data flow and my homebrew schematic with:</p>

        <p>Cars are systems. They are affected by supply chain issues
        and general complexity. Even though the unibody Ramblers with
        their rust dip would last for decades, the Chrysler acquisition
        in 1987 hindered the availability of parts. Working on a Rambler
        illustrates ideas of system resilience. Is it simple? Can it be
        re-used? Does one vendor control the distribution of parts via
        tooling? Can a human understand it and fix it? In the end,
        though, if the parts are throttled, you have to support the
        cycle of consumption and purchase a different car.</p>

        <p>I completed the first breadboard version of a Z-80 homebrew
        computer that same year, in 1980. I mounted a breadboard in the
        top of a file box, with a keypad and hexadecimal display. It
        failed miserably. I didn‚Äôt understand the concept of a
        high-impedance state for the bus, and I thought my construction
        technique was creating too much noise. I worked on and off for
        many years, breadboarding different versions. It took awhile to
        finish, with the ups and downs in my life. I would go for years
        at a time without working on it, but I finally completed a
        working, soldered system in 1992.</p>
        <p>The display in the upper right I soldered first, in 1989. You
        can see I‚Äôm using old 50 pair telco wire, which isn‚Äôt the best,
        because it can melt and cause shorts with other wires when
        soldering, but I happened to have some at the time. The lower
        right board that is connected to the bottom of the case holds
        2N2222 drivers for lamps, which you can see in this video:</p>
        <figure>

        sound.</a>
        </div>
        <p>The video shows me toggling reset. Right after reset, the
        lamps in the center, to the right, show the streaming data the
        homebrew is receiving over a PC parallel port. This is a small
        bootstrap program that looks for a byte on the parallel port
        with the correct signal line state, loads it into memory, waits
        for another state change, loads that byte into memory, repeats
        until all bytes are loaded, and, finally, jumps back to run the
        program, which cycles the incandescent lamps and the 7-segment
        displays.</p>
        <p>A bootstrap is usually entered through rows of switches and
        lights called a front panel. I couldn‚Äôt afford a proper front
        panel, so I used dipswitches and a paperclip interface with NAND
        gates in a set/reset configuration to debounce and enter data.
        Here is what I used to program the bootstrap directly into
        memory:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>The NAND gates are in the electrical tape wrapped handle of
        the perfboard. You can see the binary-decimal conversion for the
        bit locations written in between the paperclips sticking
        out.</p>
        <p>When I first breadboarded this, it started with this
        hand-drawn diagram:</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="/images/hborig.jpg" style="width:50em"

        for larger version.</a>
        </div>
        <p>As I moved the homebrew around, following jobs and
        apartments, the solder connections would break, mainly because
        of bad soldering on my part, in combination with the technical
        debt of choosing point-to-point solder on perfboard:</p>
        <figure>

        alt="Point-to-point on perfboard" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Point-to-point on
        perfboard</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I needed a way to document it, and a schematic which doubled
        as a physical diagram of the pinouts was the most effective
        reference for troubleshooting. I spent quite a few staycations
        looking at something like this:</p>
        <figure>

        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fixing the solder
        joints</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>My hand drawn version worked OK, but I realized that legible
        hand-drawn lines would be difficult to manage, and finishing the
        hand-drawn version would likely end in failure. I tried a
        variety of diagram programs, but the only one that worked for
        what I needed, that didn‚Äôt cost too much, was Xfig.</p>
        <p><a href="https://mcj.sourceforge.net/">Xfig</a> only ran on
        *NIX systems, and was my early motivation to learn GNU/Linux.
        Here is what I ended up with, which I didn‚Äôt finish until
        2003:</p>

        <p>Wiring functions like a graph, where the edge is a wire
        connecting the nodes of two connections. Or alternatively, a
        schematic is a wiring map. The intention is to create a solder
        joint that won‚Äôt break, but the reality is that they will, and
        do, and having a map of pinouts and wires goes miles towards
        keeping the homebrew running. My map distinguished control lines
        from address and bus with color coding, and curved the lines so
        they were distinguishable from each other.</p>

        <p>It isn‚Äôt a stretch to draw a comparison with Terry Davis. I
        can certainly relate to his focus. I often feel like I‚Äôm doing
        outsider art.</p>
        <p>I wrote up a high level design for my journal software in
        2011 <a href="/files/design.pdf">here</a>. Many of the design
        considerations for 3SA match. It is also the first time I
        referred to knowledge management.</p>
        <p>I use my journal to manage <a href="https://l1g3r.com">build
        steps</a> used to generate the OS that runs the journal system,
        which I am currently using to compose what you are reading right
        now (still, after all of these years). I‚Äôve tried many
        approaches over the years, using existing journal applications,
        cloud and local, and many operating systems. I always arrive
        back at something I control down to the individual operating
        system components.</p>
        <p>I couple the operating system with the journal because I am
        painfully aware of persistence issues. Operating systems and
        applications change constantly, and controlling the storage and
        view of thousands of entries requires ownership and control.
        This plays into how I see resilient knowledge tools. While it is
        true that I originally looked at LFS as a way to understand
        GNU/Linux components, over the years I have needed particular
        combinations of libraries and applications that were not
        available with the precision I needed in the current Linux
        distribution. I‚Äôve tried them all, from the original bash script
        based compilation distros that preceded Gentoo, to Gentoo, as
        well as package-based (yast, apt, yum and tarball Slackware).
        I‚Äôm actually happy, now, with where my journal software is at
        with wxPython, and Ubuntu 20.04 appears to be capable of doing
        all that I envision. I also think that KNOPPIX 9.1 might be able
        to handle it. So, eventually I will move to that, is my guess,
        but when I say that I am conscious of how interconnected and
        cumbersome the software supply chain is, and even now have a
        reluctance to move, I say that with significant background. Even
        with the extra hours of doing what most people would consider
        trivial OS tasks, overall I am more productive.</p>
        <p>Here is a screenshot of the current version, written with
        JavaScript and Python, that I‚Äôm using to write the document you
        are reading:</p>

        <p><a href="https://triple.pub">Triple System Analysis</a> (3SA)
        doesn‚Äôt tackle the maintenance of triples themselves. It is a
        way that I make the design persistent, as it pushes the ideas
        down to data rather than stopping at processes (software).
        Ultimately that is how I‚Äôm tackling my own growing collection of
        journal entries. In triple form I can create something with any
        OS. Further, by decoupling the rendering from the OS and triple
        creation, I can always read my journal with a modern web
        browser, or whatever the equivalent is. The 100 inch wheelbase
        Nash/AMC Ramblers were built around the <a href="#wrenching">196
        CI engine</a>. I think of my current journal view in that way.
        It is an engine of data, triples, surrounded by a script coach.
        Put the horse before the cart, right?</p>

        class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Energy
        Transition</h3>
        <p>In 2011 I joined an energy transition group. This was at the
        tail-end of interest in peak oil, as the U.S. fracking industry
        was changing the urgency and attention around the issue;
        however, I learned quite a bit about how the calculus of energy
        use was not as simple as battery-electric vehicles (BEVs). I
        learned how extensively oil is used in our civilization. It goes
        much further than just plastic. My interest in requirements and
        design was leveraged, as some of the same aspects were
        important: scalability, manageability, availability, etc. I
        realized that most people only understood system issues at a
        couple of degrees from origin. For instance, people could
        understand that BEVs were a good direction, and powering BEVs
        could come from photovoltaic panels or wind generators, and that
        they needed batteries, so those needed to be manufactured. The
        problem is that modern supply chains are very complex, just as
        modern software supply chains. That complexity hides
        environmental costs. Additionally, the complexity provides
        economic benefit if you ignore the environmental costs and other
        negative externalities. Mostly, at root, the magic of modern
        civilization comes from cheap oil. This formed my opinion that
        the same challenges I had in IT with human cognition were
        mirrored in broader system issues that affected everybody.</p>
