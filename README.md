# Triple Console

Demonstration of console to visualize and modify graphs, focused on Gane and Sarson notation with emoji.  Note that most graph utilities attempt to do this at the node level visually; however, this can be cumbersome, as locating the nodes on the graph quickly for even medium sized graphs takes a bit of visual scanning by participants.
